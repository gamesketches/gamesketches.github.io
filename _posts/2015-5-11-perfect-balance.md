title: Perfect Balance
---

I've recently begun making plans for actually making a fighting
game, which has led me to start putting some real thought into
game balance, and what it means. Balance is such a tricky ephemeral
thing, it's odd that it isn't discussed more. In fact, the only
person I can think of who has really delved into the topic with
any real depth is David Sirlin, who is probably considered the
closest thing to an expert on balance.

I used to read Sirlin's blog a lot and I would recommend anyone
interested in game design theory to go through and read his stuff,
with special mention to his Playing To Win series, and his blogs about
balancing SF2:HDR.

That being said, I wanted to try to take a slightly broader look
at game balance, and particularly at an idea I've been playing with
for a couple of days: Perfect Balance.

I wanted to craft a definition for Perfect Balance, because I think
it's a useful benchmark to come away from. When talking about
fighting games or tiers, people like to chime in with "Well, true
balance is impossible". It's something you can intuitively agree with
but why is that? Well I think if you create a platonic ideal of
game balance, it gets a lot clearer.

So without further ado: A Perfectly Balanced game is a game in which
all strategies have an equivalent chance of victory against all other
strategies.

That's it! Before I start talking about some of the implications for this,
I'd like to quickly define a game as a "black box" which accepts inputs
from one or more players and outputs results in the form of zero or more
winners and "strategies" as a collection of probabilities for inputs
into that system.

So we have a Perfectly Balanced Game, what does it look like? Some people
will probably immediately think of Rock Paper Scissors, but with this
definition, RPS is actually NOT perfectly balanced game. Why? Because
there are strategies that will always lose to other strategies, such as
one person playing rock every turn versus someone playing scissors every turn.
The person player scissors will ALWAYS lose to the person playing rock.

So what does Perfect Balance look like? The only game I could think of
off the top of my head was guessing a coin flip. No matter what your
strategy is, you always have an equivalent chance of winning a coin flip.
You can guess Heads every other time, you can guess tails only on flips
that are multiples of pi, you can guess heads on the fibonacci sequence, etc.
All of those strategies are equally valid, in a perfectly balanced game.

Now the money question: Is this construct actually useful? Well, I think
playing with the idea does elucidate some concepts about strategies and
what makes competitive games fun. It's pretty clear that a Perfectly Balanced
Game would not be very fun. If your strategy doesn't matter, then
your choice becomes meaningless. Meaningless choices make for meaningless games.

Another interesting consideration of a Perfectly Balanced game is game
state. Do we stick to the same definition of "all strategies have equivalent
odds of victory" or do we allow one player to have advantage by way of pure
probability? For example, in the coin flipping game mentioned above, if
the coin flips benefit a player such that one player is right 7 times and
the winner is the first to 8, the player with no correct guesses is at
a natural disadvantage. His strategies are now equally likely to win, but
his odds of winning are low. Is the game now imbalanced?

I think the key here is that neither player's strategy necessarily counteracts
the other player's. All strategies available to either player are equally likely
to lead them to victory, but the player with 7 points is necessarily more likely
to win purely by circumstance. All strategies available to either player are
equally likely to win, but one player is more likely to win.
