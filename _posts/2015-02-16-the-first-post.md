title: My first real post
---

Here's my first real attempt at a post. I've been meaning to start a real personal website for awhile. When I learned that github did website/blog hosting I hopped on pretty immediately. The name gamesketches comes from my [old blog](http://gamesketches.wordpress.com). I picked it because I was working on rapid prototyping. I thought about reviving it but I'm very into ditching blogs if I haven't updated them in awhile. I also wanted to have a website where I would have a little more freedom and control over the content. I hope to update this blog frequently with talk about games (particularly video, but any games I find interesting), mixology, and anything else I find interesting, so please stick around and enjoy.
