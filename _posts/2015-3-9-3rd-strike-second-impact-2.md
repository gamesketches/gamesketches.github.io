title: Street Fighter III, 2nd Impact vs 3rd Strike part 2
---

I wanted to build on my last post a little bit more and talk about some of the in-battle aesthetic differences between Street Fighter 3: 2nd impact and it's younger brother Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike. You can find my comparison of their character select screens [here](http://gamesketches.github.io/2015/02/24/3rd-strike-second-impact/).

The differences between gameplay visuals follow the same theme from the character select screens. 2nd Impact takes a lot of influence from mid-90s Capcom fighters, while 3rd Strike is a little more stylistic. However, while preparing this post, I found I preferred some ideas from 2nd impact over 3rd strike. With the character select screens, there's no contest, 3rd Strike's bleeds style out of the screen and into the player's eyeballs. Once in battle though, I think 3rd Strike's push towards minimalism actually hurts the visual experience.
